/**
 * Subset takes a command-line integer k; reads in a sequence of N strings from
 * standard input using StdIn.readString(); and prints out exactly k of them,
 * uniformly at random. Each item from the sequence can be printed out at most
 * once. You may assume that k â‰¥ 0 and no greater than the number of string N on
 * standard input.
 * 
 * % echo A B C D E F G H I | java Subset 3 
 * 
 * The running time of Subset must be linear in the size of the input. You may
 * use only a constant amount of memory plus either one Deque or RandomizedQueue
 * object of maximum size at most N, where N is the number of strings on
 * standard input. (For an extra challenge, use only one Deque or
 * RandomizedQueue object of maximum size at most k.)
